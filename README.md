# sample-telegram-bot
This is a very simple Telegram Bot that uses the new [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots). It's built with [Falcon](http://falconframework.org/) and can be deployed on Heroku. Don't forget to set your token as an environment variable!

This project was based on [yukuku/telebot](https://github.com/yukuku/telebot).
